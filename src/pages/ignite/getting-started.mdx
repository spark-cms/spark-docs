# Getting Started
Ignite works with JavaScript and TypeScript. You can use it in any Node.js application, and it should theoretically work with any other JavaScript frameworks
like Deno and Bun as well.

## Installation
You can install Ignite via your favorite package manager. 

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @spark-cms/ignite
```

## Usage
It is based on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and uses a class-based approach to fetch data. To start, you need to import the Ignite package and create a new Instance.

```js filename="ignite.js" showLineNumbers copy
import { Ignite } from "@spark-cms/ignite";

const spark = new Ignite({
  name: "John Doe",
  project: "Private Blog",
  token: "SPARK-a216ee62-b106-447d-98ff-e99cd70d3340",
});
```

You'll need to provide the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `string` | The name of the user the project belongs to. |
| `project` | `string` | The name of the project. |
| `token` | `string` | The API token of the project. |

Optionally, you can can provide the `cache` parameter to enable caching.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cache` | `number` | The time in seconds to cache the data. |

If no `cache` parameter is provided, the data will not be cached.
