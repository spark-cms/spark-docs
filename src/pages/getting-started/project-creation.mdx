# Your First Project
Every SPARK user has access to a number of projects. Each project is like it's own little world. It has it's own set of users, it's own set of files, 
and it's own settings. Based on your subscription, you can create a certain number of projects. For now, we'll just create one project.

## Creating a Project
To create a project, you'll need to head over to your dashboard overview. You can get there by clicking on the avatar in the top right corner of the screen, then 
selecting "Dashboard" from the dropdown menu.

You'll see a screen like the one above. To create a new project, click on the "Create Project" button. The following popup will appear:

![Create Project](/img/docs/user_dashboard_modal_open.svg)

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout>
  **Note:**<br />
  Since SPARK is a work in progress, this modal may change in the future, especially as pricing plans are adjusted.
</Callout>

You can now enter the name of your project. For this tutorial, we'll call it "My First Project". Once you've entered the name, click on the "Create Project" button. 
Once you've done that, you'll be taken to the project overview page.
